# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two points.

## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get 4 inputs from the user.
### Step 2: 
Classify with x1,x2 and y1,y2 points.
### Step 3: 
Import math module.
### Step 4: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 5: 
Display the out using format function.
### PROGRAM:
  ```

import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
  ```


### OUTPUT:
